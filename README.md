# HTML5-Editor
An HTML5-Editor written in PHP. This is made so you can run offline if you'd like to. It's still in development so please let me know if there are any issues in the program.  

## Latest Release
[Beta V.0.5.2.1](https://github.com/mamamia5x/HTML5-Compiler/releases/tag/V.0.5.2.1)  

## Issues
* When updating, error screen will sometimes pop up in  the back. What I found to work is that updating it in the WWW folder works.
* When it says the file isn't found, this is because the file hasn't been created yet. The file will be made if you press save.
* When saving, the output won't show. For some reason, the editor won't show the updated result. Just right click and press reload for the result to be updated.
## Installing
1. In order to install the app, you'll need to download PHP Desktop Chrome.  
   * [Windows](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases/tag/chrome-v57.0-rc)
   * [Linux](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/releases/tag/linux-v72.0)
   * Currently Mac isn't supported. 
2. Choose where you want it installed.

6. After that, you can download these files and then extract them. Then you put those files into the www files, and you are all set. Run the index (if it asks you to select a program, choose PHP Desktop Chrome).

## Ideas
These are some ideas I came up with, you can name some in the Issues page.
* Currently working on bugs and styling.
* Make an installer. So you'd just install the installer, and then it'll install the current version. (Just like the update checker).
* Show recent files at the top.
